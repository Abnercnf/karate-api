# Karate-pi
It was built using [karate-archetype](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate) focusing just in api test automation. 

All features were built using Swagger PetStore API.

## Prerequisites
- Java 8 or above versions
- Maven
- Some IDE like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or even VSCode(https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Note: If you prefer to use VSCcode you'll need [Karate Runner extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kirkslota.karate-runner)

## Instalation

You can just download or clone via HTTPS, SSH or CLI

Via HTTPS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abnercnf/karate-api.git
```
Via SSH 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Abnercnf/karate-api.git
```

Via Github CLI
```
gh repo clone Abnercnf/karate-api
```

## Usage

When you get the repo on your machine you are ready to import the project in your fave IDE or VSCode. But if you are a beginner in programming or test automation I strongly recommend you use IntelliJ.

Once you have importing the project run the command below:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
This command will download all project's dependencies. Once your project is successful builded you are ready to start automating.
